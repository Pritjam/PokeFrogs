# PokeFrogs
Simple collectible game in a DOS-era GUI format. The game is similar to the mobile game Pocket Frogs, and draws inspiration from it as such. To play the game, navigate to "compiled versions" and then go to the most recent version (highest number) and download the .zip file in it. Unzip it, run the .exe, and you should be good to go!
There is no guide or walkthrough--it's a simple game! Just use the "help" command, that should be all you need.
