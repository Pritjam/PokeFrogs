# PokeFrogs
Simple collectible game in a DOS-era GUI format. The game is similar to the mobile game Pocket Frogs, and draws inspiration from it as such. To play the game, navigate to "compiled versions" and then go to the most recent version (highest number) and download the .zip file in it. Unzip it, run the .exe, and you should be good to go!

There is no guide or walkthrough--it's a simple game, explore it! Just use the "help" command, that should be all you need.

If you want to build your own, just copy the source files over to your IDE, compile them, and figure out how to build them into a JAR file. Then, use a tool (I use Launch4J) to package the JAR as an executable. You'll need to have a folder called "saves" in the same directory as the executable.
